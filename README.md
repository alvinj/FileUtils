# FileUtils

These are some file utilities that I’ve written in Scala and Java.

In April, 2024, I updated some of this code to use Scala 2.13
and also Scala “best practices,” such as returning the results
inside `Try`.

Note that this is just a toy or demo project. For real-world 
applications you should use the Apache Commons file utilities
or some other industrial-grade library.
